    "In the past few episodes we've gone over design princples for reinforcement learning, introduced reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gym, and trained a deep learning model to navigate an OpenAI Gym environment. To accomplish this, we leveraged the agent-environment relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The agent takes actions in the environment. These can be random, or guided by heuristics, or by a model, or some combination. It recieves data about the environment, like a picture of the environment or a string, and then it takes an action. Afterwards, it recieves a reward from the environment, which amount to positive or negative \"reinforcement\" of the selected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The environment tracks the state, possible actions, rewards and **reward function**, and optionally renders the environment to a display. It receives actions from the agent, and it can be configured to persist data (e.g. a video of the agent performing in the environment.)\n",

    "#### Better Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous episodes we also implemented some janky, simplistic reinforcement learning. Without convolutional layers or a policy engine the network could only learn simplistic strategies (like [turn left](https://dev.to/charlesdlandau/drive-a-tank-with-python-3caf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this without reinventing the wheel we can use libraries like [Tensorflow Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents), or [OpenAI Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) which have some battle-tested implementations of the most successful agents. I've worked with a few of these libraries and I mostly came to the same conclusions as this [excellent article](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/choosing-a-deep-reinforcement-learning-library-890fb0307092) by Thomas Simonini. Namely, I like [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines), a fork of the OpenAI Baselines library.\n",

    "While that runs, let's talk about the Actor-Critic paradigm. The problem Actor-Critic solves involves none other than our reward function. In many cases the rewards only happen at the end of an \"episode\" AKA a \"game.\" Consider a reward function for tic-tac-toe:\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, our agent is taking several steps each episode which recieve no feedback at all from the reward function, slowing training and making it difficult to give fine-grained feedback to our agent about specific actions. To solve this, Actor-Critic actually implements two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  A Critic model that tries to predict reward values that a given action will earn, given an observation about the environment. The table of predicted reward values for action-observation pairs is sometimes called a \"Q table.\"\n",
    "*  An Actor model that takes observations from the environment, but not rewards. It learns a strategy for playing in the environment, AKA a \"policy.\" Instead of optimizing on the environment's rewards directly, this model optimizes on _feedback from the critic model_. When we do predictions, just the Actor model needs to be called.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each time an action is taken the Critic consults a table of actions, angles, speeds, and so on. Seeing whether the action will contribute to a successful landing, the Critic radios over to the Actor with feedback about the action, and the Actor learns to be a better pilot from the feedback. Over the course of thousands of landings, the Critic updates the table frequently based on crashes, successes, and surprises. Some days, the Actor flies with the radio turned off, but it doesn't learn anything.\n",

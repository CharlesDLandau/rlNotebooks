# rlNotebooks
Reinforcement learning notebooks for posting on the internet.

As these notebooks are instructional and experimental I don't recommend running them locally. I test and run these notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) before I run them -- you can do it there too!
